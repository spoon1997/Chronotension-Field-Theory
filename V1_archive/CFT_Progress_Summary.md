# 🧭 Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) — 2025 Progress Summary

## 🏆 Recent Achievements and Development Milestones

CFT has grown into a comprehensive field theory with both theoretical depth and empirical reach. Major breakthroughs:

### 🔹 Theoretical Milestones

- **Chronotension Core Defined**: Gravity and time unified under a viscous field model.
- **η(t) and 𝒯(x,t) Formulations**: Mathematically defined viscosity and tension fields.
- **Quantum Chronodes Introduced**: Soliton-like entities emerged as quantized knots of time.
- **Time-Remapping Framework (X(z))**: Created to reconcile observational discrepancies in H(z), SN1a, and BAO.

### 🔹 Simulation & Validation

- **CMB Fit (ℓ = 2–30, 30–200)**: Successfully reproduces axis alignment and acoustic peak structure via collapse echoes — no inflation or dark matter needed.
- **H(z) Recovery**: Overprediction solved with X(z) observer time remapping.
- **BAO Peak (~150 Mpc)**: Emerges naturally without baryon-photon plasma.
- **Gravitational Lensing**: Simulated accurately with curvature in η-field — no GR metric required.
- **SN1a Light Curves**: Flatter residuals than GR, even under uncertainty propagation.

### 🔹 Quantum & Computational Achievements

- **Chronode Stability Equations**: Soliton modeling complete via modified Schrödinger framework.
- **Soliton Collapse Visualized**: Early modeling shows time-domain compression and decoherence effects.
- **Field Simulators Built**: Scripts now generate η(x, t), tension field overlays, and propagation traces.

### 🔹 Latest Proposal: **Cosmic η(x, z) Flow Map**

- A new initiative aims to map η-variation across cosmic structure using galaxy surveys and dark flow measurements.
- Will enable next-gen remapping of time observables like H(z), BAO phase shift, and lensing delays.
- Placeholder file added to repository to track progress.
