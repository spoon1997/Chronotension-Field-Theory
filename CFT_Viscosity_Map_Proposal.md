# CFT Viscosity Map Proposal

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT)

Proposed 
h
(x, z) Viscosity Flow Map

This document introduces a proposed feature under development for Chronotension Field Theory (CFT):

a full 
h
(x, z) viscosity and time-flow map of the observable cosmos.


채
 Motivation:

  In CFT, the flow of time (viscosity 
h
) varies across space and redshift. Mapping 
h
(x, z) could allow for

  redshift corrections, H(z) reinterpretation, and even predict BAO phase offsets or SN1a residual trends.


채
 Proposed Method:

  - Use galaxy density data (e.g., SDSS DTFE field) to infer spatial viscosity based on gravitational clustering.

  - Assign 
h
-values based on known mass distributions, possibly including cosmic voids and filaments.

  - Remap time and light-paths accordingly to reinterpret cosmological observables.


채
 Implications:

  - A successful map may allow reconstruction of the entire cosmological timeline via 
h
-based remapping.

  - Potential identification of hidden anisotropies, lensing effects, and faster/slower flowing time regions.

  - Could validate CFT as a viable replacement for dark energy or as an extension to GR.


채
 Status:

  - Data sources identified (e.g., SDSS, Millennium Simulation).

  - Awaiting access to public DTFE density FITS file or reconstruction of approximate fields.

  - Simulation tools and remapping algorithms in place for testing once data is acquired.


This document serves as a placeholder and informational summary. The full 
h
(x, z) field is under active

development and will be released in future updates to the CFT project repository.
