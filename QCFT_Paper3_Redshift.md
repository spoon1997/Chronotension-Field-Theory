# QCFT Paper III – Redshift & Observables

> *Luke W. Cann, Independent Theoretical Physicist & Founder of Quantum Chronotension Field Theory*


**Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)** reinterprets the large-scale cosmological observables not as effects of spacetime expansion, but as consequences of the decay and spatial structure of the time-viscosity field η(x,t). This paper focuses on how redshift, luminosity distance, and cosmological structure measurements can be fully explained through η-decay, without invoking a metric expansion of space.

## **Redshift from Viscosity Decay**

In QCFT, redshift arises because photons traverse a universe where the effective flow of time — encoded in η(x,t) — is evolving. Rather than light stretching due to expansion, its energy appears redshifted due to differing η values between emission and observation:

\[
z_{	ext{actual}} = \eta(z) - 1
\]

This formula replaces the traditional metric-based redshift relation \(1 + z = rac{a(t_0)}{a(t_e)}\). η(z) is the time-viscosity at the location and moment of emission, measured in the observer’s η-frame.

## **Remapping the Distance Modulus**

The observed distance modulus \( \mu(z) \), normally calculated from a luminosity distance \( d_L \) using expansion history, is here derived via η(z). QCFT provides a direct mapping:

\[
d_L^{	ext{QCFT}}(z) = rac{d_L^{	ext{GR}}(z)}{\eta(z)}
\]

\[
\mu(z) = 5 \log_{10} \left( rac{d_L^{	ext{GR}}(z)}{\eta(z)} ight) + 25
\]

This relation aligns precisely with Pantheon+ SN1a data when η(z) is reconstructed empirically. No cosmological constant or accelerating universe is required — just decaying η.

## **BAO Compression Explained**

Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) appear at characteristic length scales in galaxy clustering. Under QCFT, the BAO peak scales contract due to field-based remapping:

\[
d_{	ext{CFT}} = rac{d_{	ext{GR}}}{\eta(z)}
\]

QCFT fits observed BAO peak positions by modeling how sound waves propagate through a decaying viscosity field, not an expanding metric. The “compression” of peak positions is not anomalous but expected.

## **CMB Angular Scale and η-projection**

While addressed more fully in Paper V, this paper introduces how CMB anisotropies — especially the first acoustic peak — can be mapped using η²-weighted angular correlations. The remapped angular scale of the CMB temperature fluctuations stems from the spatial coherence of η at the time of last scattering.

---

## **Direction-dependent η Mapping**

QCFT allows observational datasets (SN1a, BAO, CMB) to reconstruct η(z, direction) rather than assume isotropy. Anisotropies in redshift and structure formation reflect gradients in η(x,t), offering a field-based approach to mapping the cosmos:

\[
	ext{Gradia} = |
abla \eta(x,t)|
\]

Where Gradia is high, gravitational effects are enhanced; where η is flat, field behavior is inertial.

## **Contrast with ΛCDM**

| Aspect | ΛCDM | QCFT |
|--------|------|------|
| Redshift | Metric expansion | η-decay |
| Acceleration | Dark energy | None needed |
| SN1a dimming | Expanding space | Viscosity decay |
| BAO scale | Co-moving | η-scaled |
| CMB peaks | Early universe physics | Present η-structure |

QCFT offers a simpler explanation for the same observations, using fewer assumptions and avoiding unobserved entities like dark energy.

## **Conclusion**

Observational evidence — from supernovae to large-scale structure — supports a reinterpretation of redshift and cosmic history through viscosity decay. QCFT replaces spacetime expansion with η(x,t) dynamics, producing the same measurable outcomes while offering new explanatory power and falsifiability.

---

**Summary:**  
Redshift, SN1a dimming, BAO scaling, and CMB angular structure all emerge as natural consequences of η-field evolution. The universe is not expanding — it is *unfurling*. QCFT ties observational cosmology directly to a physical field, not a geometric illusion.

**Time does not stretch space.  
Time flows — and changes as it flows.**
