## ⚖️ Intellectual Property & Attribution

All original materials related to **Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)** — including but not limited to:

- Theoretical constructs and field equations (e.g., η(x,t), Gradia, Chronodes)
- All Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formulations
- Simulation methods, soliton models, and redshift equations
- Naming conventions, topological frameworks, and emergent gauge mappings
- Visualizations, LaTeX renderings, diagrams, code, or interactive tools
- All remapped observational data (e.g., SN1a, BAO, CMB) interpreted via QCFT
- Consciousness theory components, η-gap models, and speculative extensions

are the protected intellectual property of **Luke W. Cann**, governed by international copyright,
moral rights, and fair-use doctrine.

## ✅ Permitted Use (Non-Commercial Academic & Educational)

QCFT material may be used, referenced, and redistributed **freely** for the following purposes:

- Academic research, institutional study, and peer citation
- University lectures or seminars
- Public documentation and non-profit educational content

**Conditions:**
- Full attribution must be given to *Luke W. Cann*
- The theory’s status as **in-development** or **non-standard** must be acknowledged
- All derivative edits must be clearly marked
- Links must point back to the official QCFT repository (GitHub or OSF)

## ❌ Prohibited Use (Monetized or Commercial)

QCFT may **not** be used or adapted in commercial, monetized, or proprietary contexts **without written permission**. This includes:

- Paid books, courses, or subscription platforms based on QCFT
- Mobile apps, games, or simulations with QCFT-derived mechanics behind a paywall
- Patents filed using η-field behavior or Gradia sensing without consent
- AI models, software frameworks, or tools trained directly on QCFT content for profit
- Branding, merchandise, or domains using QCFT-specific terms (e.g., “Chronode AI”)

Unauthorized use will be considered a violation of intellectual property protections and may result in legal action.

## 🛡️ Trademark & Patent Strategy (In Progress)

Future legal protections are being explored for key elements of QCFT, including:

- Chronode-based computing and topology-mapped logic circuits
- Gradia sensing and field navigation tools
- Software solvers for η-knot modeling and wave resonance
- Quantum timing mechanisms based on local η modulation
- Medical diagnostics based on η-coherence disruption

Trademark and patent filings are **not yet submitted**, but legal rights are **reserved**.
