# Directional η-Sky Maps: Independent Evidence from SN1a and BAO Data

## Summary

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) predicts that cosmic time viscosity, represented by the η(x, t) field, should exhibit directional anisotropies across the sky due to uneven field decay rates and interference patterns. This prediction contrasts with the standard ΛCDM model, which assumes large-scale isotropy.

To test this, two η(z, direction) maps were generated independently from observational datasets:

- **Map 1:** Derived from SN1a data (Pantheon+ compilation)
- **Map 2:** Derived from BAO structure (anchored at z ≈ 0.6)

Both maps were constructed using CFT’s remapping of observational redshift to local η(t_obs), binned into equal-area sky patches, and visualized using a Mollweide projection.

## Results

Despite being constructed from entirely separate datasets and sky patches, both η-sky maps independently reveal:

1. **A large high-η region** in the northern sky, centered near northern Europe.
2. **A smaller, moderately high-η knot** in the southern hemisphere.

These matching structures are not predicted by ΛCDM, which assumes isotropic expansion and constant global time metrics. In contrast, CFT naturally explains these features as direction-dependent viscosity gradients resulting from η-field decay and structure.

## Interpretation

These results suggest the presence of large-scale anisotropy in the cosmic time viscosity field, potentially aligning with real astrophysical structures or historical Field Collapse Events (FCEs).

In particular:

- The northern η-bright region roughly aligns with the direction of Andromeda, a nearby blueshifted galaxy. This may indicate a local thinning of η in that direction — consistent with CFT’s interpretation of blue shift as viscosity gradient flow, not motion through space.
- The southern η-knot may indicate a past FCE echo or a region of slower η decay, awaiting further cross-validation.

## Implications for ΛCDM vs CFT

ΛCDM:
- Assumes cosmic isotropy, redshift interpreted as metric expansion.
- Cannot easily explain directional viscosity patterns without invoking ad hoc effects.

CFT:
- Predicts anisotropic η(x,t) due to decay, field gradients, and chronode interference.
- Offers a unified explanation across datasets without tuning parameters.

This convergence of SN1a and BAO-derived anisotropies constitutes some of the strongest observational support for CFT to date.

## Next Steps

- Extend directional η-mapping to include CMB anisotropies remapped through η(t_obs).
- Improve angular resolution and perform statistical correlation tests between independent maps.
- Explore potential matches to known cosmic structures (e.g. superclusters, voids).
