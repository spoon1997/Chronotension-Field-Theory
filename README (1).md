## 🧠 What is CFT?

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) proposes that time and gravity are not fundamental forces or geometric dimensions, but emergent behaviors of a **continuous, resistive time-field** — denoted \(\eta(x,t)\). In this view:

- The universe does **not expand** spatially — it **unfurls** as the resistance to time flow decreases.
- Redshift, gravity, and structure arise from **temporal viscosity**, not mass-energy curvature.

This theory replaces the metric fabric of GR with a **field of time resistance**, yielding new explanations for:

- Supernova dimming
- BAO patterns
- CMB structure
- Hubble tension
- Quantum behavior

## 🧪 Experimental Falsifiability

Paper VII outlines four testable predictions:
- **SN1a Stretch** should follow η(z), not (1 + z)
- **BAO Peak** should shift under η remapping
- **Voyager Clocks** may drift across η-field boundaries
- **CMB Amplitude** should reflect η_obs damping, not inflation energy
