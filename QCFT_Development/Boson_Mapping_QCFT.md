# 🧩 Boson Mapping in Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)

This document presents the QCFT reinterpretation of the Standard Model bosons as coherent wave excitations, pulses, and topological modulations in the ηᵃ(x,t) field — the time-viscosity field of Chronotension Theory.

## 🔷 Summary Table

| Boson      | QCFT Interpretation         | Structure                     | Mass     | Spin | Key Insight |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Photon (γ)**     | U(1) ηᵃ pulse                  | Transverse wave               | 0        | 1    | Oscillating ηᵃ winding; guided by field coherence |
| **W⁺ / W⁻**        | SU(2) twist pulses            | Charged η² torsion waves      | ~80 GeV  | 1    | Compressing η² pulses with charge winding |
| **Z⁰**            | Neutral SU(2) pulse          | η² breathing mode             | ~91 GeV  | 1    | Mass via compression, neutral twist |
| **Gluons (g)**     | SU(3) color braid pulses      | Braided ηᵃ twist              | 0        | 1    | Confined to color-neutral systems; nonlinear braid interactions |
| **Higgs (H⁰)**     | Scalar η² resonance           | Radial field breathing        | ~125 GeV | 0    | Not a separate field — intrinsic η² oscillation |
| **Graviton (g?)**  | ∇η tension wave (hypothetical) | Second-order ripple in ηᵃ     | 0        | 2    | Modulates local time flow; curvature emerges from tension |

## 📡 Photon (γ)

- **Massless**, **spin-1**
- U(1) transverse wave in ηᵃ
- Polarization: Orientation in η¹–η² winding plane
- **No self-interaction**; interference arises from ηᵃ field coherence
- Speed limited by local η(x,t): \( c = \eta(x,t) \)

---

## ⚔ W⁺, W⁻, Z⁰ Bosons

### W⁺ and W⁻
- Charged, massive ηᵃ twist pulses in SU(2)
- Rapid decay via twist transfer
- Local η² compression responsible for mass

### Z⁰
- Neutral SU(2) pulse
- No net winding
- Short-lived η² breathing disturbance

---

## 🧶 Gluons

- SU(3) braid pulses
- Massless, spin-1
- Strongly nonlinear self-interactions
- Topologically confined — cannot exist free due to unstable η²

---

## 🌐 Higgs (H⁰)

- Not a separate scalar field
- Scalar compression of η²: breathing resonance
- Spin-0, ~125 GeV pulse
- Mass arises from η² rebound dynamics during field stress

---

## 🕳 Graviton (tentative)

- If it exists, it’s a **∇η(x,t)** ripple
- Spin-2, massless
- Not a particle, but a modulation of time viscosity tension
- Explains gravitational effects without invoking spacetime curvature

---

**All bosons in QCFT emerge from structured dynamics of ηᵃ(x,t)** — through winding, twisting, compression, or tension — without requiring external fields.
