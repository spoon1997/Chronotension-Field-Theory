CFT Simulation Package
---------------------

This package includes core simulation scripts for Chronotension Field Theory (CFT):

1. simulation.txt - Numerically evolves viscosity η(x,t) and tension T(x,t)
2. metric_symbolic.txt - Symbolic derivation of effective metric from η(x,t)
3. geodesics.txt - Solver for particle and light trajectories in the effective metric

To use:
- Open each file in a Python-capable editor or Jupyter notebook.
- Follow instructions in comments.
- Install: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy

Enjoy exploring the dynamics of time!
