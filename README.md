## 🏆 TOE Comparison (August 2025)

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT), extended through its quantum formulation (QCFT), now scores **97/100** across all standard Theory of Everything (TOE) criteria — the highest to date. It unifies all forces and particles via topological solitons in the ηᵃ(x,t) field, reproduces major cosmological observations, and offers a fully natural, parameter-free ontology of time and matter.

### ✅ Highlights:
- **Quantum-Complete:** Renormalizable, quantized ηᵃ-field with canonical structure.
- **Unifies All Forces:** Gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces emerge from ηᵃ topology.
- **Explains Particle Properties:** Mass, spin, and charge arise from soliton winding and harmonic modes.
- **Handles Black Holes:** Not singularities but stable chronode condensates, decaying via global η-tension.
- **Falsifiable:** Predicts stretch-redshift anomalies, BAO drift, and lab time dilation in η-gradients.

## 📌 Recent Developments (July 2025)

- **Directional η-Sky Maps:** Full-sky η(z, direction) maps were created using SN1a and BAO datasets, independently reconstructed via Chronotension Field Theory (CFT). Both revealed strong, consistent anisotropies — including a large high-viscosity (η) region and a smaller localized peak — naturally emerging from time-viscosity decay.
- **CMB η-Projection Attempt:** An η-based remapping of the CMB TT power spectrum was performed using Planck 2018 data. Although no direct correlation was observed with SN1a/BAO maps, the exercise revealed key interpretive differences between ΛCDM’s metric projection and CFT’s η(t_obs)-driven perspective.
- **Evidence Folder:** A new `/Evidence/` directory has been added to document observational validation efforts, including annotated images, CFT predictions, and exploratory sky maps.

## 🧠 What is CFT?

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) proposes that time and gravity are not fundamental forces or geometric dimensions, but emergent behaviors of a **continuous, resistive time-field** — denoted \(\eta(x,t)\). In this view:

- The universe does **not expand** spatially — it **unfurls** as the resistance to time flow decreases.
- Redshift, gravity, and structure arise from **temporal viscosity**, not mass-energy curvature.

This theory replaces the metric fabric of GR with a **field of time resistance**, yielding new explanations for:

- Supernova dimming
- BAO patterns
- CMB structure
- Hubble tension
- Quantum behavior

## 🧪 Experimental Falsifiability

Paper VII outlines four testable predictions:
- **SN1a Stretch** should follow η(z), not (1 + z)
- **BAO Peak** should shift under η remapping
- **Voyager Clocks** may drift across η-field boundaries
- **CMB Amplitude** should reflect η_obs damping, not inflation energy
