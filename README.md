## Overview

Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) is a unified physical framework that replaces spacetime with a dynamic, quantized **time-viscosity field**, denoted **η(x,t)**. All classical, quantum, and cosmological phenomena emerge from gradients in this field.

In QCFT:
- **Gravity becomes Gradia**: tension in η replaces curvature
- **Particles become chronodes**: solitonic knots in ηᵃ
- **Redshift becomes decay**: wavelength stretching arises from cumulative viscosity change
- **Forces emerge topologically**: gauge symmetries arise from field braiding
- **Consciousness arises from coherence**: awareness is modeled as structure in η-gaps

The theory includes a complete Lagrangian formalism, quantized interaction mechanics, and a falsifiable cosmology — with no reliance on metric expansion, dark matter, or virtual particles.

## Core Concepts

- **η(x,t)** – Time-viscosity field; the fundamental medium of temporal structure
- **Gradia** – ∇η; replaces gravity and dark matter as the source of field tension
- **Chronodes** – Topological solitons in ηᵃ(x,t); correspond to all known particles
- **Field Collapse Events (FCEs)** – Local η → 0; causes collapse, emission, and structure death
- **Gauge Emergence** – SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) arise from braids, twists, and η-topology
- **Canonical Redshift** –  
  \[
  1 + z = \exp\left( \int_{\text{path}} \frac{d\eta(x,t)}{\eta(x,t)} \right)
  \]
- **η-Gap Consciousness** – Awareness arises from coherent interference zones between chronodes
