# Chronotension Field Theory (CFT)

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) proposes that gravity and quantum phenomena arise from the dynamic viscosity and tension of time itself, modeled as a continuous field η(x,t). This repository contains:

- 📄 Full paper PDF (CFT_Complete_Paper.pdf)
- 📊 Diagrams and simulations
- 🔬 Quantum extension: Chronotension Quantum Field Theory (C-QFT)
- 🧠 Cross-domain implications: from cosmology to chemistry to consciousness

## 🚀 Highlights

- Matches supernova Ia data, CMB spectrum (low-ℓ), and redshift-distance observations
- Fully self-regularizing QFT with no infinities
- Replaces gauge symmetries with η-phase analogs
- Explains inertia, charge, spin from η-flow around chronodes
- Offers radical implications for fusion, AI, propulsion, and beyond

> “Quantum mechanics may not be uncertain — it may be **resistant**, shaped by the viscosity of time itself.”
