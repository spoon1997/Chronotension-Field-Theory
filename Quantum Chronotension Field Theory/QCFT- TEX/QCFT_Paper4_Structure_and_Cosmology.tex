\begin{abstract}
This paper extends Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) into the cosmological domain, revealing a fundamentally new model of cosmic structure formation. In QCFT, spacetime is emergent, driven by gradients in a time-viscosity field $\eta(x,t)$. Galaxies, voids, black holes, and the entire cosmic web are reinterpreted as artifacts of $\eta$-tension---called Gradia---rather than the result of spacetime curvature or unseen matter. This shift provides a coherent, testable alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM.

\section{Introduction}

The standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, relies on dark matter and dark energy to account for structure, expansion, and cosmic evolution. Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) provides an entirely different framework: one in which time, not spacetime, is the underlying field, and viscosity gradients in this field drive cosmic behavior.

\section{The $\eta$-Field as a Cosmological Driver}

The time-viscosity field $\eta(x,t)$ determines local time flow. Its spatial gradient---\emph{Gradia}---drives apparent gravitational structure:

\[
\text{Gradia}(x,t) \equiv |\nabla \eta(x,t)|
\]

High Gradia creates clustering, lensing, and apparent mass, replacing the need for cold dark matter. Cosmological evolution proceeds through $\eta$-decay, not metric expansion.

\section{Galaxies and Chronode Clustering}

Galaxies form as chronodes---stable $\eta$-solitons---aggregate in high-$\eta$ zones. Surrounding halos are regions of increased Gradia, not dark matter. Orbital stability and lensing arise from field tension.

\section{Black Holes and High-$\eta$ Cores}

QCFT redefines black holes as dense clusters of chronodes held together by extreme $\eta$. Their apparent invisibility results from sharp $\nabla \eta$. Over time, $\eta$ decays globally, destabilizing these structures, leading to Field Collapse Events (FCEs).

\section{Cosmic Web and Void Formation}

Filaments form along $\nabla \eta$ interference lines. Voids are low-$\eta$ zones where chronodes cannot stabilize. The web-like structure of the universe emerges from $\eta$-wave dynamics, not gravity.

\section{Temporal Unfurling of the Universe}

Rather than an expanding space, QCFT posits an unfurling of time:

\[
\eta(t_{\text{obs}}) \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{as} \quad t \rightarrow \infty
\]

Structure emerges from differential $\eta$ values. Redshift and horizon distance reflect temporal decay, not geometric motion.

\section{Falsifiable Predictions}

QCFT offers testable differences from $\Lambda$CDM:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gradia lensing signatures will differ from GR
    \item Chronode decay zones emit structured $\eta$-wave echoes
    \item Void anisotropies align with $\eta$-interference, not primordial density perturbations
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

QCFT eliminates dark matter, inflation, and expansion. It reproduces observed phenomena---SN1a, BAO, CMB---through $\eta$-dynamics. The universe's complexity is a function of temporal viscosity gradients.

\section{Conclusion}

QCFT redefines cosmology as an unfolding of structured time. Gradia, not curvature, drives the cosmic web. Observables arise from field dynamics, not metric constructs. This framework is predictive, testable, and self-contained.
