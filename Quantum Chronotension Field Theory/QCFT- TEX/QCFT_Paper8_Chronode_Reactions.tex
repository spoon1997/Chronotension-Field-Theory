\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT), particles are redefined as chronodes—solitonic topological excitations in the time-viscosity field $\eta^a(x,t)$. All interactions, decays, and reactions arise from field-based transformations rather than force mediation or virtual particles. This paper formalizes chronode interaction principles, conservation rules, and S-matrix dynamics, demonstrating QCFT’s capacity to reconstruct and exceed the Standard Model without invoking spacetime curvature.
\end{abstract}

\section{Chronodes as Fundamental Actors}

Chronodes are not mediated particles, but field structures. Their charge, mass, and spin emerge from twists, braids, and windings in $\eta^a(x,t)$. Energy is stored via field tension and compression.

\section{Interaction Principles}

Chronode interactions include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Merging: Compound chronode forms (e.g., mesons)
\item Splitting: Field decays into sub-chronodes
\item Braiding: Reorientation of topology
\item Annihilation: Opposite charges unwind into eta-waves
\end{itemize}

These replace virtual particles and bosonic mediators.

\section{Scattering and Energy Exchange}

Interaction strength scales with:

\[
\sigma \sim V_{\text{overlap}} \cdot \eta^2 \cdot \text{Phase Coherence}
\]

Where $V_{\text{overlap}}$ is field overlap volume. High Gradia increases interaction rate.

\section{Field Conservation Rules}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\eta^2$ is globally conserved:
\[
\int \eta^2 \, d^3x = \text{const}
\]
\item Topological charge (winding, braid) is conserved
\item Interference governs reaction channels
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples of Chronode Interactions}

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Reaction & QCFT Interpretation \\
\midrule
$e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ & Opposite windings cancel $\rightarrow$ eta-wave pulses \\
$u + d \rightarrow \pi^+$ & Merging with color braiding \\
$\mu^- \rightarrow e^- + \nu$ & Topological relaxation \\
$\nu_e \leftrightarrow \nu_\mu$ & Field phase oscillation \\
$g + g \leftrightarrow g$ & Braided reconfiguration \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\section{Mapping to the Standard Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item Color confinement from braid instability
\item Weak interactions from eta-tension transitions
\item Mass from eta-inertia (field curvature)
\item Charge from U(1) winding
\item Gauge symmetry as topological rotation: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)
\end{itemize}

\section{Open Questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chronode collapse at ultra-high eta
\item Early asymmetry and baryogenesis
\item Phase-resonant amplification of rare decays
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}

All quantum interactions in QCFT arise from deterministic, topological transitions in the eta-field. Chronodes are self-contained field configurations, and their behavior defines matter, force, and structure.
