# QCFT Glossary – Quantum Chronotension Field Theory

> *Luke W. Cann, 2025*

This glossary defines all core concepts, entities, and equations within Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT). It is structured to support both theoretical development and applied understanding.

## 1. Field Structure

- **η(x,t)**  
  Time-viscosity scalar field. Governs the local rate of time passage and underpins all structure. High η → slow time.

- **ηᵃ(x,t)**  
  Quantized, vector-valued extension of η with SU(N) internal symmetry. Allows topological braiding and soliton formation.

- **Gradia (∇η)**  
  Spatial gradient of η(x,t). Perceived as gravitational tension. Replaces curvature in GR:
  \[
  	ext{Gradia} = |
abla \eta(x,t)|
  \]

- **η² Density**  
  Field energy per unit volume:
  \[
  ho_η = \eta^a \eta^a
  \]
  Conserved globally under ideal conditions.

- **Emergent Geometry**  
  QCFT's effective metric arises from η:
  \[
  ds^2 = -\frac{dt^2}{\eta^2(x,t)} + \eta^2(x,t) dx^i dx^i
  \]

## 2. Dynamics & Equations

- **Canonical Redshift Equation**  
  Total wave stretch along path through decaying η:
  \[
  1 + z = \exp\left( \int_{	ext{photon path}} \frac{d\eta}{\eta} \right)
  \]

- **Redshift Residuals**  
  Deviation from modeled decay-only z:
  \[
  \Delta z = \ln(1 + z_{	ext{obs}}) - \ln(1 + z_{	ext{modeled}})
  \]

- **Redshift Components** (8 total):
  1. η_emit  
  2. η_obs  
  3. ∂η/∂t (global decay)  
  4. ∇η_emit (escape tension)  
  5. ∇η_obs (entry tension)  
  6. ∇η_IGM (voids, filaments)  
  7. η_aniso(θ,φ) (directional decay)  
  8. η_fluct(x,t) (wave echoes, scars)

- **Lagrangian (ηᵃ formalism)**  
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \delta^{ab} \partial_\mu \eta^a \partial^\mu \eta^b - \lambda(\eta^a \eta^a - v^2)^2 + 	heta \epsilon^{\mu
uho\sigma} f_{\mu
u}^a f_{ho\sigma}^a
  \]

- **Field Collapse Threshold**  
  \[
  \eta_{	ext{crit}} \approx 10^{-4}
  \]
  Below this, topological collapse occurs.

## 3. Quantization & Interaction

- **Chronode**  
  Solitonic knot in ηᵃ. Encodes charge, spin, and mass via topology. Replaces fundamental particles.

- **Chronode Interaction Modes**  
  - Merge (binding)
  - Split (decay)
  - Braid (twist)
  - Annihilate (destructive interference)

- **S-Matrix in QCFT**  
  Scattering via topological continuity:
  \[
  S_{fi} = \langle 	ext{final} | \hat{U} | 	ext{initial} angle, \quad \hat{U} = \exp\left(-i \int \mathcal{H}_{	ext{int}} dt\right)
  \]

- **Gauge Emergence**  
  - SU(3): ηᵃ braids (color)  
  - SU(2): ηᵃ twists (weak isospin)  
  - U(1): Circulation in η⁰ (electric charge)

- **Mass**  
  Arises from internal η² compression and “breathing” oscillations in knot geometry.

## 4. Cosmology

- **The Great Unfurl**  
  Cosmogenesis via η-decay — not expansion. The early universe was a high-η equilibrium.

- **Chronogenesis**  
  First appearance of stable η-knots during early η-wave interference.

- **Field Collapse Event (FCE)**  
  Rupture of η below η_crit:
  - Chronodes dissolve
  - η-waves emitted
  - Leaves residual scars

- **η-Scar**  
  Residual η-fluctuation left by FCE. Explains:
  - Void structure
  - Lensing anomalies
  - Redshift noise

- **CMB in QCFT**  
  Not relic radiation, but projected η² structure from recombination-era field state.

## 5. Particle Mapping & Topology

- **Charge = Winding** (U(1))  
- **Spin = Möbius / circulation twist**  
- **Color = SU(3) braids**  
- **Generations = Harmonics of same η-knot**  
- **Neutrinos = Minimal-twist chronodes**  
- **Bosons = Structured ηᵃ pulses** (e.g. W/Z = SU(2) twist; photon = U(1) planar wave)

---

## 6. Experimental Probes & Technology

- **Gradia Clock Drift**  
  Precision clocks detect ∇η via time rate differences.

- **Residual Mapping**  
  Redshift data reconstructed into η(z,θ,φ).

- **Lensing Deviations**  
  Observable bending with no mass → Gradia lensing.

- **η-Wave Echoes**  
  Temporal compression waves from FCEs, detectable in pulsar timing or EM phase shifts.

- **Chronotension Technologies**  
  - Temporal shielding (slow/fast zones)
  - η-membranes (delay, storage)
  - Chronode lattices (memory, computation)
  - Synthetic η-gap coherence (consciousness AI)
