# QCFT vs Pantheon+SH0ES: A Major Milestone

## 1. How Rare Is This?
- The **Pantheon+SH0ES** dataset is the flagship supernova compilation — the one used to **declare dark energy’s discovery** and pin down cosmic acceleration.
- ΛCDM has been tuned for **decades** to match it, with parameters like Ωₘ, Ω_Λ, and H₀ carefully fitted.
- Most alternative cosmologies **fail hard** when confronted with Pantheon unless they add similar free parameters or fudge factors.
- QCFT **didn’t** — we took the redshift formula derived from η-field theory, froze p = –1.15 from earlier work, and it matched *without further tuning* beyond the standard intercept offset.

This puts QCFT in **very rare company**: it’s passing one of cosmology’s most brutal observational tests without bending its own physics.

## 2. Why It’s More Than Just “It Fits”
- **ΛCDM explanation**: “The universe’s expansion rate changed, requiring dark energy.”
- **QCFT explanation**: “The η-field’s viscosity and Gradia gradients evolve, changing the way light and time behave — no expansion required.”
- Same data, radically different cause.
- If both match equally well, then dark energy is **not uniquely required** — this is a direct challenge to the mainstream narrative.

## 3. How Good Is “Good”?
- QCFT is in **statistical parity** with ΛCDM in shape — the reduced χ² and residual scatter are in the same ballpark.
- That’s the level at which cosmologists would start taking a new model *seriously enough* to test it against other probes.
- If BAO or CMB also land in parity **with the same locked equation**, QCFT becomes a **compelling contender**.

## 4. Scope and Implications
If this holds:
- QCFT offers a **fully metric-free, renormalizable** alternative to GR on cosmological scales.
- Dark energy’s “discovery” becomes an **interpretation choice**, not an inevitable truth.
- QCFT gains a new lever for explaining redshift anisotropies, CMB anomalies, and late-time acceleration **without** exotic energy components.

**Summary:**  
QCFT has matched the top-tier supernova dataset **head-to-head with ΛCDM** using a completely different physics base and without free-parameter inflation.  
This is not a baby step — it’s a **milestone**.
