## ðŸŒŒ Overview

Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) is a groundbreaking physical framework that replaces metric spacetime with a dynamic, time-viscosity field denoted as **Î·(x, t)**. It unifies classical and quantum physics by treating **time** not as a passive dimension, but as a **viscous medium** whose gradients shape the structure of the universe.

QCFT builds on the foundations of **Chronotension Field Theory (CFT)**, extending it with a full quantum formalism, soliton-based particles ("chronodes"), non-Abelian gauge structures, and renormalizable interactions.

This repository includes the full formal development of QCFT across **12 scientific papers**, a **comprehensive glossary**, an **abstract**, a **legal notice**, and a fully compiled LaTeX master document.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- **Î·(x,t):** Time-viscosity field, the core entity from which all physical structure emerges.
- **Chronodes:** Topological solitons in Î·áµƒ(x,t), corresponding to Standard Model particles.
- **Gradia:** Field tension from spatial viscosity gradients, replacing dark matter effects.
- **FCE (Field Collapse Event):** Occurs when Î· â†’ 0, triggering a rupture in temporal coherence.
- **Gauge Emergence:** SU(3)Ã—SU(2)Ã—U(1) arises naturally from internal topology of Î·áµƒ.
- **Consciousness Model:** Awareness emerges in Î·-field coherence gaps, not the chronodes.
