# CFT Principle Quote — Disagreement is the Point

> “I no longer worry if CFT contradicts ΛCDM — I expect it to. That’s the whole point.”  
> — *Luke W. Cann*

This quote represents a core philosophy of CFT: disagreement with mainstream models is not a flaw, but a **purposeful strength**.  
Because CFT begins from a different physical ontology, alignment with ΛCDM is not expected — only **alignment with data** is.
