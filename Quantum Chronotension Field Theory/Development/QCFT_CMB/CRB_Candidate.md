# QCFT Candidate Predictions

QCFT is still in development. Some consequences are locked-in (e.g. η-hogging redshift law, Gradia as gravity, τ ≈ 20–30 for CMB blackbody perfection).  

Other consequences are more speculative but *testable*. These are valuable because they offer **falsifiable branches** of the theory: if they show up in data, that strongly supports a given QCFT mechanism; if not, QCFT may favor another interpretation.

This file lists **candidate predictions** — bold but provisional — that we expect can be tested with current or near-future data.

## 1. CMB–CRB Anti-Correlation (Candidate)

**Hypothesis:**  
- CMB *hot spots* (slightly brighter microwave regions) arise where the η\_crit boundary is closer, rebounding energy back inward.  
  - Prediction: those directions should show **less CRB** (radio background deficit).  
- CMB *cold spots* (slightly dimmer microwave regions) arise where the boundary is further.  
  - Prediction: those directions should show **more CRB** (radio background excess).

**Why testable:**  
- CRB has already been detected (ARCADE-2, EDGES), but not yet mapped in full-sky anisotropy.  
- Future facilities (e.g. SKA) could produce CRB maps and cross-correlate them with Planck CMB data.  
- In ΛCDM there is no expected correlation, so any detection of anti-correlation would be strong evidence for QCFT.

**Caveat:**  
- QCFT may have other viable CRB mechanisms (diffuse long-path stretch, web scattering, halo contributions).  
- This anti-correlation scenario is a **candidate branch** — falsifiable, but not locked-in.  
- If not observed, QCFT may still explain CRB differently.

## Philosophy of Candidate Predictions
- These are not “laws” of QCFT, but **testable branches**.  
- Their purpose is to make QCFT bold **without boxing it in**.  
- Each candidate lives or dies with data. If falsified, QCFT is not discarded, but this branch is pruned.  
- If confirmed, QCFT gains strong, unique support.
