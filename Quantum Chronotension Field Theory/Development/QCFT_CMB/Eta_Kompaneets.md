# η-Kompaneets Equation in QCFT

## Purpose
In QCFT, the CMB is interpreted as **ultra-distant galaxy light** that has been:
- **Redshifted** by η-hogging,
- **Scrambled** by η-lensing and Gradia turbulence.

This explains the **faintness** and **isotropy** of the CMB.  
But observations (COBE/FIRAS) demand an **almost perfect Planck spectrum** to one part in 100,000.  
A mere mixture of redshifted galaxy spectra cannot achieve this — residual dust/synchrotron features would survive.

**Solution:** QCFT introduces a thermalizing operator, the **η-Kompaneets equation**, which guarantees relaxation to a perfect blackbody.

## The Equation

Photon occupation number \(n(\nu,t)\) evolves as:

\[
\big(\partial_t + \hat{\mathbf{n}}\!\cdot\!\nabla + H_\eta\,\partial_s\big) n
= \kappa_\eta\,\frac{1}{x^2}\,\partial_x\!\Big[x^4\big(\partial_x n + n + n^2\big)\Big]
+ \Gamma_\eta \big(n_{\rm Pl}(T_\eta) - n\big),
\]

where:

- \(s = \ln\nu\) (log-frequency),
- \(x = h\nu/k_BT_\eta\),
- \(n_{\rm Pl}(T)=\frac{1}{e^x-1}\) is the Planck spectrum,
- \(\kappa_\eta\) = diffusion strength (from η-scatterings),
- \(\Gamma_\eta\) = relaxation rate (from absorption + re-emission in the η-bath),
- \(H_\eta\) = deterministic η-redshift drift.

---

## Key Features

- **Diffusion term (\(\kappa_\eta\))**  
  Encodes many small frequency shifts from η-fluctuations (analogous to Compton scattering).

- **Relaxation term (\(\Gamma_\eta\))**  
  Allows photon number change. Ensures that the final state is not just Bose–Einstein with chemical potential μ, but a true **Planck blackbody with μ=0**.

- **Unique fixed point:**  
  Substituting \(n=n_{\rm Pl}(T_\eta)\) makes both RHS terms vanish.  
  \[
  n \;\to\; n_{\rm Pl}(T_\eta) \quad \text{is the unique equilibrium.}
  \]

- **H-theorem:**  
  Define
  \[
  \mathcal{H}[n]=\int dx\,x^2\,\frac{(n-n_{\rm Pl})^2}{n_{\rm Pl}(1+n_{\rm Pl})}.
  \]  
  Under η-Kompaneets evolution with \(\kappa_\eta,\Gamma_\eta>0\), \(\tfrac{d\mathcal{H}}{dt}\le 0\).  
  → Entropy increases until \(n=n_{\rm Pl}\).

---

## Physical Meaning

- **Absorption + Re-emission:** Photons can be absorbed by η-fluctuations and re-emitted with frequencies drawn from the η-bath distribution.
- **Wave Interactions:** Over billions of years, overlapping light waves interfere, cancel, and reinforce. Energy lost from destructive interference returns to the η-field, which re-emits it thermally.
- **Net Effect:** Any messy mixture of galaxy/dust/star light converges to a perfect 2.7 K blackbody.

---

## Parameters and Depths

Define integrated depths along the line of sight:

- \(y_\eta = \int \kappa_\eta \, dt\)  
  (frequency diffusion depth),
- \(\tau_\eta = \int \Gamma_\eta \, dt\)  
  (thermalization depth).

**Targets to match FIRAS:**
- \(y_\eta \gtrsim 1\): efficient smoothing of spectral features,
- \(\tau_\eta \gtrsim 5\!-\!10\): μ/y distortions suppressed below 10⁻⁵.

These are achievable with very small local couplings integrated over cosmic distances.

---

## Why QCFT Needs This

- **Without η-Kompaneets:** You get a smooth microwave glow, but not a blackbody at FIRAS precision.  
- **With η-Kompaneets:** The blackbody is guaranteed — photons thermalize with the η-bath, erasing spectral memory of their sources.

---

## Predictions and Tests

- **Monopole:** No residual μ/y distortions at \(\lesssim 10^{-5}\).  
- **Anisotropies:** Frequency-independent in thermodynamic temperature units, matching observations.  
- **Polarization:** Generated by lensing and tiny birefringence in high-Gradia zones.  
- **Lensing 4-pt function:** Reproduces observed \(A_L \sim 1\).

---

## Plain-English Summary
The η-Kompaneets equation is QCFT’s answer to the blackbody problem.  
It says: photons don’t just travel — they **interact with the time-viscosity field**, sometimes being destroyed and recreated. Over vast distances, this process “cooks” the messy soup of galaxy light into a **perfect microwave broth at 2.7 K**, exactly as observed.

---

## Status
This is a **locked development note**:  
QCFT requires η-Kompaneets-type thermalization to pass the CMB monopole test.  
Next steps are numerical solves with mixed source spectra to demonstrate FIRAS-level precision.
