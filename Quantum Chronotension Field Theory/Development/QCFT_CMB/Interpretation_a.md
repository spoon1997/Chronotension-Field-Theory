# QCFT Reinterpretation of the CMB Acoustic Peaks

## 1. Core Picture
- **Finite, unbounded cosmos:** the η-field lives on a compact 3-space of effective radius R_η.
- **Standing modes:** η-waves form normal modes:
  $$
  k_n \simeq \frac{n\pi}{R_η}, \quad n=1,2,\dots
  $$
- **Angular projection:** features appear at multipoles:
  $$
  \ell_n \approx n\,\Delta\ell - \phi_η, 
  \quad \Delta\ell \equiv \frac{\pi D_A}{L_η}
  $$
  where D_A is the angular-diameter distance to the η-horizon and L_η is the fundamental η-mode length (analog of sound horizon).

**Interpretation:** The CMB peak comb (first peak ~220, spacing ~300) comes from η-mode harmonics, not baryon acoustic waves.

## 2. Amplitudes & Damping
- **Envelope:** viscous η-diffusion at horizon crossing gives a damping tail:
  $$
  C_\ell^{TT} \propto \exp\!\Big[-(\ell/\ell_{ηD})^{m_η}\Big]
  $$
- **Odd–even pattern:** ΛCDM baryon loading boosts odd peaks. QCFT instead predicts a small Gradia–baryon coupling (ξ_b ≪ 1).
  - **Prediction:** weaker odd–even alternation than ΛCDM.

---

## 3. Polarization & Phase
- **E-modes:** from η-quadrupole anisotropy at the η-mixing surface.
- **TE relation:** ~π/2 out of phase with TT, but with a distinct phase shift φ_TE.
  - **Prediction:** small but coherent TE/EE phase offset compared to ΛCDM.
- **B-modes:** mainly η-lensing of E; predicts a lensing amplitude A_η slightly > 1.
  - **Prediction:** mild extra smoothing of TT peaks.

## 4. Frequency Spectrum
- CMB is the η-smeared superposition of distant sources (stars, galaxies, BHs).
- η-thermalization yields near-Planck spectrum with μ,y-distortions ≲ few×10⁻⁵ (consistent with COBE/FIRAS).
  - **Prediction:** small frequency-dependent anisotropy residuals, testable with next-gen spectral probes.

---

## 5. Large-Angle Structure & Topology
- Finite volume ⇒ low-ℓ mode cutoff.
  - **Prediction:** real suppression of quadrupole/octopole, mild alignments, intrinsic not statistical.

## 6. Numerical Differences from ΛCDM
1. **Peak spacing:** nearly constant, set by Δℓ = πD_A/L_η.
2. **First-peak position:** ℓ_1 ≈ Δℓ − φ_η; QCFT predicts different φ_η than ΛCDM.
3. **Odd–even contrast:** reduced relative to ΛCDM.
4. **Damping tail:** different exponent m_η than Silk damping (m=2).
5. **TE/EE phases:** shifted phase offset relative to ΛCDM.
6. **Lensing amplitude:** A_η > 1 (few %).
7. **Low-ℓ suppression:** intrinsic to finite η-geometry.

## 7. Falsifiability Tests
- **Peak-phase test:** If TE/EE match ΛCDM exactly, QCFT fails.
- **Odd–even test:** Strong baryon-loading pattern inconsistent with ξ_b ≪ 1 → QCFT fails.
- **Damping-shape test:** High-ℓ spectra demanding m=2 precisely → QCFT fails.
- **Lensing amplitude test:** If A_η = 1.00 ± 0.01, QCFT’s lensing expectation fails.
- **Spectral distortions:** If μ,y ≲ 10⁻⁸ with no correlated anisotropy residuals, QCFT thermalization fails.

## Plain English
Instead of "sound waves in a baby universe," QCFT says the CMB’s peaks are **η-field harmonics** in a finite cosmos. You still get a peak comb, but the **spacing, phases, damping, and odd–even contrast** come from η-physics, not baryons. This gives clean, checkable differences: weaker odd–even alternation, tiny TE/EE phase shifts, slightly different damping, a bit more lensing smoothing, and built-in low-ℓ suppression. If data keep pointing that way, QCFT’s take on the CMB wins; if not, it loses—clean and fair.
