# QCFT Reinterpretations

---

## Overview

This section systematically compares key concepts in **mainstream physics** with their **reinterpretation under Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)**.

Each file explores how QCFT explains the same phenomena — **more clearly, causally, and without paradox** — by replacing spacetime, particles, and forces with dynamics of the time-viscosity field **η(x,t)**.

---

## Purpose

- To demonstrate **QCFT’s explanatory power** across modern physics.
- To **resolve long-standing paradoxes** in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and field theory.
- To showcase how QCFT eliminates the need for:
  - Photons
  - Spacetime curvature
  - Wave-particle duality
  - Dark matter / dark energy
  - Inflation
  - Observer-dependent collapse

---

## Format

Each file follows this structure:

- **Topic**  
- **Standard Interpretation**  
- **QCFT Interpretation**  
- **Why QCFT Is Better**  
- **Optional**: Diagrams, field sketches, or equations

## Topics (In Progress)

| File                          | Concept Reinterpreted         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `01_light_vs_photon.md`       | Light as η-wave, not particle |
| `02_gravity_vs_gradia.md`     | Gradia replaces gravity       |
| `03_spacetime_vs_eta_field.md`| No metric, only η(x,t)        |
| `04_quantum_collapse_vs_fce.md`| FCE replaces wavefunction collapse |
| `05_wave_particle_duality.md` | Duality resolved by topology  |
| `06_black_hole_vs_chronode_cluster.md` | Black holes as field knots     |
| `07_dark_matter_vs_gradia.md` | Tension, not missing mass     |
| `08_inflation_vs_eta_decay.md`| No inflation — slow η decay   |

More will be added as the theory is applied across disciplines.
