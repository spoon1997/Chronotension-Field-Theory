# QCFT Glossary  

### Luke Cann — Independent Theoretical Physicist & Author of Quantum Chronotension Field Theory  

This glossary defines the central terms, notations, and concepts of **Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)**. Entries combine precise technical definitions with interpretive language where appropriate. It provides the controlled vocabulary for the QCFT paper series.

## 1. Core Field Concepts

**η(x,t)**  
The scalar *time-viscosity field* at cosmological scale. Represents the local resistance of time to change. Larger η corresponds to “thicker” time.  
*Note*: Scalar η is a coarse-grain projection of the fundamental SU(N) vector field ηᵃ, valid when anisotropies average out.  

**ηᵃ(x,t)**  
The fundamental SU(N) vector-valued form of the η-field. Carries internal indices a = 1,…,N. All chronodes, forces, and gauge sectors emerge from its dynamics.  

**Time viscosity**  
The effective property of the universe whereby the flow of time resists change. Formally quantified by η. Replaces “curvature of spacetime” in QCFT.  

**Gradia**  
Defined as the magnitude of the η gradient:  
\[
\mathrm{Gradia}(x,t) \equiv |\nabla \eta(x,t)|
\]  
Functions as the analogue of gravitational tension. Scalar by default; tensor generalizations appear in strong-field regimes.  

**Chronode**  
A solitonic knot of the ηᵃ-field. Encodes particle identity (mass, charge, spin) via topology. Leptons map to thin-shell harmonics; baryons to 3-braid chronodes; mesons to unstable 2-braids. Chronodes have finite radii determined by balance of gradient, potential, and topology.  

**η² conservation**  
A global conservation law:  
\[
\int \eta^a \eta^a \, d^3x = \text{constant}
\]  
Guarantees unitarity and prohibits global time-reversal.  

**Field Collapse Event (FCE)**  
Occurs when η drops below a critical threshold η\_crit. Triggers rupture of local structures, producing η-waves and chronode spray. Resets are local, with mesoscale percolation via η-waves. η² conservation remains exact.

## 2. Geometry & Dynamics

**Emergent metric**  
A didactic effective metric derived from η:  
\[
ds^2 = -\frac{dt^2}{\eta^2(x,t)} + \eta^2(x,t) \, dx^i dx^i
\]  
Used for intuition; not fundamental ontology.  

**Cann shell**  
Stable η-shell surrounding a compact chronode cluster (black hole analogue). Forms a family (attractor class) parameterized by λ, v, and ambient η. Thickness and profile are not unique but converge to characteristic forms. Fails at η < η\_crit, producing eruptions.  

**Thin-shell law**  
Mass scaling rule for leptons:  
\[
m_\ell \;\sim\; \eta^2 \times (\text{shell thickness}) \times (\text{mode number})
\]  
Mode number denotes a discrete thin-shell harmonic (belt index), topologically protected. Environment/η-pressure provides percent-level renormalizations only.  

**Gradia Influence Radius (GIR)**  
The resonance scale where overlapping Gradia shells stabilize a feature in the cosmic web. Sets the BAO peak at ≈127 Mpc. Half the BAO scale corresponds to a typical galaxy’s GIR.  

**Hogging**  
Redistribution of η by chronodes and structures. Causes redshift, arrow of time, and cosmic cycles.  

**Unfurling**  
Large-scale redistribution or “aging” of η via hogging. No metric expansion is assumed.

## 3. Quantum Extensions

**Chronode state |χ⟩**  
Quantum state representation of a chronode. Defined in Fock-like sectors built from ηᵃ modes.  

**S-matrix in QCFT**  
Interaction amplitudes derived from η-kernels. Internal lines represent Green’s functions of the η-kernel (field-overlap propagators). Virtual particles are not ontic entities.  

**Topological charge**  
Conserved quantities of chronodes: winding number (U(1)-like), braid class (SU(3)-like), and parity (torsion orientation).  

**Braid topology**  
- 2-braid: mesons (unstable, prone to decay).  
- 3-braid: baryons (stable; proton ground state, neutron excited).  

**Marginal chronodes**  
Weakly bound, minimal-twist chronodes with very small compression. Identified with neutrinos: solitonic but effectively behave as long-coherence η-wavepackets.  

---

## 4. Gauge Emergence

**Gauge emergence**  
U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) interactions arise as topological sectors of ηᵃ. Not imposed symmetries but emergent field structures.  

**Bosons as η-waves**  
Photon = η-wave mode in U(1) winding. W/Z = SU(2) twist pulses. Gluons = SU(3) braid pulses. None are fundamental quanta; all are effective η-field excitations.  

**Graviton**  
Not a particle. Gravity appears as the spin-2 sector of η/∇η ripples in the emergent metric limit. No graviton quanta are posited.  

---

## 5. Cosmological Mapping

**Redshift law**  
QCFT redshift is:  
\[
(1+z_{\text{QCFT}}) = (1+z_{\text{GR}})^{p}, \quad p \approx -1.15
\]  
Universal to leading order. Small path-dependent modulations (p\_eff) are allowed at the few-percent level.  

**BAO resonance**  
The ≈127 Mpc peak is an emergent resonance from overlapping Gradia shells (GIRs), sharpened by η-lensing. Effectively frozen after web maturation.  

**CMB reinterpretation**  
The observed microwave background is interpreted primarily as lensed and scattered CRB through structured η. A dominant fraction is expected, with a residual baseline allowed. Near-Planckian spectrum emerges via many-scatter (Kompaneets-like) diffusion. Small μ/y distortions are permitted within current bounds.  

**Cosmic web**  
Large-scale structure traced by ∇η filaments and voids. Does not require CDM: lensing is attributed to Gradia structure. In interim analyses, an “effective DM” placeholder may appear where Gradia mapping is incomplete.  

**Eternal finite universe**  
No beginning singularity. Universe persists as finite, cyclic η-field structure, continually reshaped by FCEs.

## 6. Entropy & Information

**η-entropy**  
Entropy is the topological complexity of η, not just smoothness. A dense chronode network has higher entropy than a smooth η profile.  

**Information scrambling**  
At Cann-shell eruptions, information is redistributed as structured η-waves. No loss; only scrambling.  

**Local vs global resets**  
FCEs reset entropy locally. Waves percolate outward, but there is no global “all-at-once” reset.  

---

## 7. Conceptual & Interpretive Terms

**Braided time**  
QCFT interpretation of time: braided, looped, knotted within the η-field, rather than linear or geometric.  

**Awareness gap**  
Speculative hypothesis: consciousness may emerge from smooth η-gaps between chronodes. Not a locked result.  

---

## 8. Shorthand & Jargon

- GIR = Gradia Influence Radius  
- FCE = Field Collapse Event  
- η\_crit = Critical viscosity threshold for collapse  
- Topo-chronode = Chronode labeled by braid class  
- Unfurling = Redistribution of η through hogging  
- Hogging = Redistribution of η by chronodes
