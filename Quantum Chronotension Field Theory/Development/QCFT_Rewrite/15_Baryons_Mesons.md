## 1. Introduction  

In the Standard Model, hadrons are explained as bound states of quarks, held together by gluon exchange within Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). While effective, this model leaves confinement, mass hierarchies, and mixing as axiomatic or parameter-driven.  

Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) reframes hadrons as **composite chronodes**: stable or unstable braid structures of the ηᵃ-field.  

- **Baryons** correspond to 3-strand braid chronodes.  
- **Mesons** correspond to 2-strand braid chronodes.  

This approach explains confinement, stability, and decay patterns as consequences of topology rather than imposed gauge dynamics.

## 2. Baryons as 3-Braid Chronodes  

- Proton and neutron = topologically stable 3-braid chronodes.  
- **Color charge**: encoded in the braid class; permutations map to SU(3)-like structure.  
- **Confinement**: braids are topologically closed, preventing separation of strands.  
- **Stability**: 3-braids resist unwinding, making the proton exceptionally stable.

## 3. Mesons as 2-Braid Chronodes  

- Mesons = 2-strand braid chronodes.  
- **Instability**: 2-braids lack full topological closure, so residual tension drives decay.  
- **Interpretation**: explains why pions and other mesons are unstable compared to baryons.  

---

## 4. Pion Properties  

- Pions = minimal 2-braid chronodes.  
- **Light mass**: arises from shallow η-binding compared to baryons.  
- **Instability**: 2-braid openness makes pions prone to decay into lighter leptons or photons.  
- **Lifetime**: short-lived, consistent with experimental data.  

---

## 5. Proton vs Neutron  

- **Proton** = ground-state 3-braid; maximally stable.  
- **Neutron** = perturbed 3-braid with slight η-imbalance.  
- Free neutrons decay outside nuclei when marginal stability fails, consistent with observed lifetime.

## 6. CKM-Like Mixing in QCFT  

In the Standard Model, quark flavor mixing is encoded in the CKM matrix, with free parameters.  

In QCFT:  
- Mixing arises from **braid reconfiguration probabilities**.  
- Transition amplitudes set by η-kernel overlap, not by arbitrary couplings.  
- Flavor-changing processes reflect braid transitions within the η-field.

## 7. Variational Method for Masses  

Masses and radii of baryons and mesons follow from the QCFT energy functional:  

\[
\mathcal{H} = \tfrac{1}{2} (\pi^a)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} (\nabla \eta^a)^2 + \lambda(\eta^a \eta^a - v^2)^2 .
\]  

- **Proton**: compact 3-braid minimizes the functional → stability and higher mass.  
- **Pions**: shallow 2-braid solutions → lighter, unstable states.  

Relative hadron mass scales emerge from variational energy minimization.

## 8. Comparison with Standard QFT  

| Feature              | Standard Model (QCD)                 | QCFT                                    |  
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Binding mechanism    | Gluon exchange                       | η² braid topology                        |  
| Confinement          | Postulated, unsolved problem         | Topological closure of braids            |  
| Meson instability    | Dynamical decay via gluon exchange   | Topological unwinding of 2-braids        |  
| Proton stability     | Empirical                           | Ground-state 3-braid minimum             |  
| Mixing (CKM)         | Free matrix parameters               | Braid reconfiguration probabilities      |  

QCFT replaces dynamical assumptions with topological necessity.

## 9. Predictions and Falsifiers  

1. **Meson instability**: pions inherently unstable due to open 2-braid topology.  
2. **Proton scattering**: braid structure predicts small positive curvature in elastic slope.  
3. **Mass ratios**: calculable from variational QCFT energy functional, testable against hadron data.  
4. **Mixing**: CKM-like transitions must follow braid geometry, offering falsifiable correlations.  

---

## 10. Summary  

- **Baryons** = 3-braid chronodes (stable, topologically closed).  
- **Mesons** = 2-braid chronodes (unstable, unwind under η-tension).  
- Proton stability, neutron decay, and pion properties follow naturally.  
- CKM mixing arises from braid reconfiguration, not arbitrary matrices.  
- QCFT unifies lepton and hadron hierarchies through one field ontology.  

Baryons and mesons are thus not quark–gluon composites but **topological chronodes in η**, with predictive structure that resolves confinement and mixing puzzles.
