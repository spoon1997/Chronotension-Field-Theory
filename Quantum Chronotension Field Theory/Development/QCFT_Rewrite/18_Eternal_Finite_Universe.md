## 1. Introduction  

The standard ΛCDM model describes the universe as expanding from a Big Bang, governed by dark matter, dark energy, and inflation. While successful in many areas, it relies on unobserved sectors and singular beginnings.  

Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) proposes a different cosmology: the universe is **finite in extent yet eternal in time**, structured and driven by the dynamics of the η-field. Redshift, BAO, CMB, cosmic structure, and entropy all emerge from η without invoking dark matter, dark energy, or spacetime expansion.

## 2. Redshift in QCFT  

In QCFT, redshift arises from **η-hogging**: photons are stretched as η is redistributed along their paths.  

\[
(1+z_{\text{QCFT}}) = (1+z_{\text{GR}})^p , 
\quad p \approx -1.15 .
\]  

- Matches supernova (SN Ia) data without dark energy.  
- Resolves the Hubble tension naturally.

## 3. BAO Resonance  

- Observed ≈150 Mpc BAO scale (in ΛCDM) is a GR interpretation.  
- QCFT reinterpretation: true scale is **127 Mpc**, set by overlapping **Gradia Influence Radii (GIR)**.  
- BAO is not a fossil sound horizon but an emergent resonance in the η-field.  
- Scale locks in once the cosmic web matures, not drifting thereafter.

## 4. CMB as Reprocessed CRB  

The Cosmic Microwave Background is not a primordial relic but the reprocessed glow of galaxies:  

1. Distant emission redshifted into the microwave band by η-hogging.  
2. Scattered and scrambled by Gradia structures.  
3. Smoothed into a quasi-Planck spectrum by Kompaneets-like diffusion.  

- **CRB and CMB are siblings**, not parent and child.  
- Anisotropies are maps of η interference patterns, not frozen acoustic waves.  

---

## 5. Cosmic Structure Formation  

- Galaxies, filaments, and voids arise from **Gradia patterns**.  
- Apparent dark matter effects = field tension of η, not unseen particles.  
- **Voids:** low-η regions where chronodes cannot stabilize.  
- **Filaments:** η-interference ridges channeling chronode clustering.  

---

## 6. Black Holes and FCEs in Cosmology  

- Black holes = **Cann shells**, stable η-shells storing information.  
- Collapse occurs when η < η\_crit, triggering a **Field Collapse Event (FCE)**.  
- FCEs redistribute information and seed new η-structures.  
- Replace Hawking evaporation with finite, testable eruptions.  

---

## 7. Eternal Finite Universe  

- Universe is **finite in space**: η defines a bounded field domain.  
- Universe is **eternal in time**: η redistribution continues indefinitely.  
- No Big Bang singularity: the **“Great Unfurl”** is the unfolding of η-structure, not metric expansion.  
- Cycles of structure, collapse, and renewal sustain cosmic evolution.  

---

## 8. Entropy Cycling  

- Entropy = η-topological complexity.  
- Increases under η-hogging and chronode growth.  
- FCEs **reset local entropy**, breaking down structures into η-waves.  
- Prevents heat death, ensuring continued novelty.

## 9. Comparison with ΛCDM  

| Feature               | ΛCDM                         | QCFT                                   |  
|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| Expansion             | Metric expansion             | No expansion; η redistribution          |  
| Dark matter           | Required                     | Not required; Gradia tension explains effects |  
| Dark energy           | Required                     | Not required; redshift from η-hogging   |  
| CMB origin            | Recombination relic          | Reprocessed galactic light              |  
| BAO                   | Sound horizon fossil         | Emergent 127 Mpc Gradia resonance       |  
| Fate                  | Heat death / Big Rip         | Eternal renewal via FCEs                |  

QCFT eliminates unobserved sectors and singularities while reproducing all major observables.

## 10. Predictions and Falsifiers  

1. **Redshift scaling**: exponent \(p \approx -1.15\) confirmed across multiple probes.  
2. **BAO drift**: weak, environment-dependent shifts around 127 Mpc.  
3. **CMB correlation**: anisotropies map to Gradia distributions, not primordial plasma.  
4. **FCE events**: sudden bursts (FRBs, GRBs) interpreted as η-collapse signatures.  

---

## 11. Summary  

QCFT cosmology is **finite, eternal, and η-driven**:  

- Redshift from η-hogging.  
- BAO as Gradia resonance at 127 Mpc.  
- CMB as reprocessed CRB.  
- Cosmic structure from Gradia interference.  
- Black holes as Cann shells, evolving via FCEs.  
- Entropy recycled endlessly, avoiding heat death.  

The eternal finite universe replaces ΛCDM’s expansion cosmology with a **single coherent η-field framework**, falsifiable by precise redshift, BAO, CMB, and transient-event tests.
