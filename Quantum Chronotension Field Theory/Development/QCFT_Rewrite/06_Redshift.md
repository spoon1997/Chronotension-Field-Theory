## 1. Introduction  

The cosmological redshift is one of the foundational observables of modern cosmology. In the standard ΛCDM model, redshift is interpreted as the stretching of wavelengths due to the expansion of space itself. To reconcile high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) with this interpretation, ΛCDM requires the introduction of **dark energy** — a hypothetical repulsive component accelerating expansion.  

Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) offers a different explanation. In QCFT, **time is a field with viscosity**, and redshift arises from the redistribution of that field — a process called **η-hogging**. As photons propagate, their wavelengths stretch cumulatively, not because space expands, but because η has been locally consumed and redistributed by structures. The result is a redshift law that explains SN Ia data without invoking dark energy.

## 2. Derivation of the QCFT Redshift Law  

The core law of QCFT redshift is:  

\[
(1+z_{\text{QCFT}}) = (1+z_{\text{GR}})^{p}, \quad p \approx -1.15 .
\]  

Here, \(z_{\text{GR}}\) is the redshift predicted by GR’s metric expansion, and \(p\) is the QCFT exponent reflecting η-hogging.  

- **Continuous effect:** photons accumulate redshift gradually as they traverse gradients of η.  
- **Boundary effect:** additional contributions occur at strong Gradia boundaries (e.g. galactic shells, cosmic walls).  

This law arises from path-integration of the photon’s interaction with the η-field:  

\[
z_{\text{QCFT}} \;\sim\; \int_{\text{path}} \frac{d\eta}{\eta}.
\]  

The exponent \(p\) encodes the integrated history of η-redistribution along the trajectory.

## 3. Local vs Boundary Contributions  

QCFT predicts two complementary contributions:  

1. **Local accumulation:** gradual stretching from background η redistribution.  
2. **Boundary boosts:** step-like increases at regions where Gradia is sharp, such as the edge of galaxy clusters or GIR shells.  

The total effect is additive. A photon may accumulate small shifts in voids, punctuated by discrete jumps at Gradia-rich boundaries. This matches observations of heterogeneous redshift environments.

## 4. Data Fit: SN Ia Hubble Diagram  

The Pantheon+SH0ES SN Ia dataset has been tested against the QCFT redshift law.  

- With \(p = -1.15 \pm 0.05\), the QCFT model fits the entire dataset.  
- Residuals lie at the **noise level**, with no systematic trends.  
- No dark energy is required. No arbitrary tuning or extra free parameters are introduced.  

The notorious **Hubble tension** — the discrepancy between local and high-z measurements of the Hubble constant — disappears. The same redshift law accounts for both regimes.  

---

## 5. Interpretation of \(p\)  

The exponent \(p\) has physical meaning.  

- A **negative value** indicates that η-hogging stretches photons more strongly than metric expansion alone.  
- It encodes the integrated redistribution of η along the photon’s path.  
- \(p\) is **universal to leading order**, but small deviations (\(p_\text{eff}\)) are allowed at the few-percent level due to environmental differences (e.g. denser Gradia webs).  

Thus \(p\) is not a fudge factor: it is a measurable probe of cosmic η-distribution.

## 6. Implications  

1. **No dark energy**  
   Apparent acceleration is an artifact of η-hogging. The universe is not driven by a repulsive force.  

2. **No “big rip”**  
   Because the universe is not expanding, runaway expansion is excluded. The cosmos ages as η is redistributed, not as space stretches.  

3. **Distances are overestimated in GR**  
   Standard luminosity distances are biased by assuming expansion. QCFT predicts systematically shorter true distances for high-z objects.  

---

## 7. Comparison with GR/ΛCDM  

- **GR/ΛCDM:** redshift = metric expansion; dark energy required to fit SN Ia.  
- **QCFT:** redshift = η-hogging; no dark energy needed.  
- **Testable difference:** QCFT predicts small **path-dependent deviations** from perfect scaling, measurable in principle. ΛCDM does not.

## 8. Predictions and Falsifiers  

1. **Redshift drift**  
   Direct time-domain measurement of redshift with precision atomic clock networks should follow QCFT’s η-law, not ΛCDM’s expansion law.  

2. **Anisotropy**  
   Directional differences in η-distribution (e.g. toward Andromeda) will produce measurable redshift anisotropy.  

3. **BAO and SN distances**  
   QCFT predicts systematic shifts in derived distances compared to ΛCDM, because redshift is not tied to scale-factor expansion.

## 9. Summary  

The QCFT redshift law is a **locked result**:  

1. **Equation:** \((1+z_{\text{QCFT}}) = (1+z_{\text{GR}})^p\), with \(p \approx -1.15\).  
2. **Mechanism:** cumulative η-hogging along photon paths, with boundary boosts at Gradia shells.  
3. **Fit:** Pantheon+SH0ES SN Ia data match with residuals at the noise level.  
4. **Resolution:** Hubble tension vanishes; no dark energy is needed.  

Redshift in QCFT is **mechanical** (η redistribution) rather than **geometric** (expansion).  

This sets the stage for **Paper 7**, which explains how the BAO scale emerges from Gradia Influence Radius resonances at ≈127 Mpc.
