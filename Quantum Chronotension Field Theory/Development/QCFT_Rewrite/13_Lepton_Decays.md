## 1. Introduction  

In the Standard Model, lepton decays are explained by weak interactions mediated by W bosons, with lifetimes set by Yukawa couplings. This framework reproduces observations but relies on free parameters and an imposed gauge structure.  

Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT) provides a deeper mechanism. Leptons are **thin-shell chronodes**, and their lifetimes and β-spectra follow from η-field geometry. No Yukawa couplings are required. Decay rates scale universally with mass, and the shapes of β-spectra arise from η-kernel overlap rather than virtual particle exchange.

## 2. Thin-Shell Chronodes and Leptons  

- **Leptons = thin-shell chronodes**:  
  - Electron: ground-state harmonic.  
  - Muon: second harmonic.  
  - Tau: third harmonic.  

- **Mass origin:** thin-shell compression of η² curvature.  
- **Hierarchy:** higher harmonics store more η-curvature, making them unstable against decay.  

Leptons are thus a harmonic ladder of the same underlying chronode topology.

## 3. Scaling of Lepton Lifetimes  

Lepton lifetimes obey a universal scaling law:  

\[
\Gamma_\ell \;\propto\; m_\ell^5 ,
\]  

where \(m_\ell\) is the lepton mass.  

- This scaling matches experimental μ and τ lifetimes.  
- QCFT explanation: thicker shells (heavier leptons) hold greater η-curvature, which unwinds more rapidly.  
- No Yukawa couplings are needed; decay follows directly from field geometry.  

---

## 4. Muon Decay  

\[
\mu^- \;\to\; e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu
\]  

- Muon = second harmonic thin-shell chronode.  
- Decay = unwinding from second to first harmonic (electron).  
- Surplus topology shed as marginal chronodes (neutrinos).  
- Rate scaling: \(\Gamma_\mu \propto m_\mu^5\), consistent with experiment.

## 5. Tau Decay  

The tau, as the third harmonic, collapses more violently.  

- **Leptonic channels:** τ → eνν, τ → μνν.  
- **Hadronic channels:** τ → hadrons + ν.  

QCFT: τ harmonic rupture tends to eject braid fragments, giving ~60–70% probability of hadronic products. This explains the observed hadronic branching fraction naturally.

## 6. Neutrinos in β-Spectra  

- Neutrinos = **marginal chronodes** (minimal-twist, weakly bound).  
- Behave as long-coherence η-wavepackets with tiny masses.  
- Their emission smears decay energy into a continuum, producing smooth β-spectra.  

---

## 7. β-Spectrum Shape  

- **Standard QFT:** β-spectrum = phase space shaped by W exchange.  
- **QCFT:** β-spectrum = η-kernel overlap between decaying chronode and emitted neutrino wavepackets.  

Predictions:  
- Smooth continuum arises naturally.  
- Slight deviations expected in spectrum tails — a testable difference from SM weak theory.

## 8. Comparison with QFT  

| Feature               | Standard Model (QFT)         | QCFT                                  |  
|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
| Mass mechanism        | Yukawa couplings + Higgs     | Thin-shell compression harmonics       |  
| Interaction mediator  | W boson exchange             | η-kernel overlap                       |  
| Decay scaling         | Tuned via couplings          | Universal \(m^5\) scaling              |  
| β-spectrum shape      | Virtual W exchange phase space | η-wavepacket overlap                  |  

QCFT replaces free parameters with structural necessity.

## 9. Predictions and Falsifiers  

1. **Lifetime scaling:** μ and τ lifetimes follow \(m^5\) law exactly.  
2. **Hadronic τ branching:** naturally ~0.6–0.7, from braid spray.  
3. **β-spectrum tails:** small deviations from SM predictions, testable in next-generation precision experiments.  

---

## 10. Summary  

- Leptons are **thin-shell chronodes** organized as harmonic modes.  
- Lifetimes scale with \(m^5\), consistent with data, no Yukawas required.  
- Neutrinos are marginal chronodes, producing smooth β-spectra.  
- QCFT replaces weak boson mediation with η-kernel overlap.  
- Predictions include branching ratios and testable β-spectrum deviations.  

Lepton decays and β-spectra thus provide a strong confirmation of QCFT’s chronode dynamics, showing how topological geometry replaces gauge assumptions.
