## 1. Introduction  

A scientific theory must be testable. For a comprehensive framework like Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT), predictions must be presented in a way that distinguishes between **critical falsifiers** — results that would overturn the theory — and **diagnostic tests** — results that may require refinement of mechanisms without invalidating the framework.  

This paper presents QCFT’s predictions as a field guide for experimental and observational programs.

## 2. Critical Falsifiers (Locked Predictions)  

These are locked results. If observations contradict them, QCFT requires fundamental revision.  

### 2.1 Redshift Law  
QCFT predicts that redshift follows:  

\[
(1+z_{\text{QCFT}}) = (1+z_{\text{GR}})^p, 
\quad p \approx -1.15 .
\]  

- Established by SN Ia data fits.  
- No dark energy required.  
- **Critical falsifier:** if datasets confirm \(p = 1\) (GR value), QCFT’s redshift law collapses.  

### 2.2 BAO Resonance Scale  
- QCFT: BAO scale = **127 Mpc**, from overlapping Gradia Influence Radii.  
- ΛCDM: interprets scale as ~150 Mpc sound horizon.  
- **Critical falsifier:** if the true BAO scale is confirmed to be 150 Mpc invariantly under all interpretations, QCFT’s BAO framework fails.  

### 2.3 Cann Shells vs GR Black Holes  
- QCFT: black holes are **Cann shells**, finite η-shells with eruptions at η < η\_crit.  
- GR: predicts singularities and event horizons.  
- **Critical falsifier:** if all black hole observations confirm exact GR predictions (shadows, ringdowns, evaporation) with no deviation, QCFT collapses.  

### 2.4 η² Conservation  
QCFT enforces global η² conservation:  

\[
\int \eta^a \eta^a \, d^3x = \text{const}.
\]  

- **Critical falsifier:** if any experiment detects net creation or annihilation of η², QCFT cannot stand.

## 3. Diagnostic Tests (Refinement Mechanisms)  

These tests probe QCFT’s mechanisms. If they miss, QCFT survives but requires refinement.  

### 3.1 BAO Environment Drift  
- Prediction: BAO peak shifts slightly (~0.5%) with environment density.  
- If absent: Gradia resonance may be dominated by η-lensing, not overlap.  

### 3.2 Field Collapse Events (FCEs)  
- Prediction: FRBs/GRBs exhibit structured η-wave echoes.  
- If absent: coupling of collapse to observable channels may need revision.  

### 3.3 Strong-Gradia Birefringence  
- Prediction: polarization-dependent photon propagation in strong ∇η regions:  

\[
v_{\text{phase}}(\hat{e}) \approx \frac{1}{\eta} 
\left[ 1 \pm \alpha \frac{\nabla \eta \cdot \hat{e}}{\eta} \right].
\]  

- If absent: birefringence may be suppressed or masked in astrophysical data.  

### 3.4 Lepton Decay Scaling  
- Prediction:  
  \[
  \Gamma_\ell \propto m_\ell^5 ,
  \]  
  with τ hadronic branching ≈ 0.6–0.7.  
- If deviations appear: thin-shell law may require higher-order corrections.  

### 3.5 Proton Scattering Curvature  
- Prediction: small positive curvature in elastic slope (dσ/dt).  
- If absent: η-kernel nonlinearity model requires refinement.  

### 3.6 CMB / CRB Reinterpretation  
- Prediction: CMB is reprocessed CRB with near-Planck spectrum and small μ/y distortions.  
- If absent: η-scattering models may need additional transport corrections.

## 5. Conclusion  

QCFT offers a structured field guide of predictions:  

- **Critical falsifiers**: redshift law, BAO resonance scale, Cann shells, and η² conservation.  
- **Diagnostic tests**: BAO drift, FCEs, birefringence, lepton decays, proton scattering, and CMB reinterpretation.  

This tiered framework ensures QCFT is both **falsifiable** and **refinable**. Critical predictions make the theory bold, while diagnostic tests allow growth without collapse.  

QCFT therefore provides a clear roadmap for experimental physics: a theory that can be tested, refined, or overturned, but never hidden behind untestable assumptions.
