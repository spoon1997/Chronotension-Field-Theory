# QCFT Paper III – Redshift & Observables

> *Luke W. Cann, Independent Theoretical Physicist & Founder of Quantum Chronotension Field Theory*

**Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)** reinterprets cosmological redshift as a consequence of the evolution of the time-viscosity field \( \eta(x,t) \), rather than spacetime expansion. Redshift arises from cumulative changes in viscosity and tension along the wave's trajectory, including both global decay and spatial gradients. This paper presents the canonical formulation of redshift in QCFT, its decomposition into measurable components, and its implications for supernovae, BAO, and the CMB.

## **Canonical Redshift Equation in QCFT**

The total redshift experienced by a wave is governed by the path-integrated change in \( \eta \):

\[
1 + z = \exp\left( \int_{	ext{photon path}} rac{d\eta(x,t)}{\eta(x,t)} ight)
\]

This general form accounts for both temporal decay and spatial η-gradients (Gradia). It replaces the simplified ratio \( 1 + z = \eta_{	ext{emit}} / \eta_{	ext{obs}} \), which is now treated as a limiting case.

---

## **Contributing Components to Redshift**

The redshift integral decomposes into identifiable contributing factors:

1. **η_emit** – viscosity at emission site (e.g., SN1a core)
2. **η_obs** – viscosity at observer (Earth)
3. **∂η/∂t** – global decay over cosmic time
4. **∇η_emit** – Gradia at emission site (escape from η-well)
5. **∇η_obs** – Gradia at reception (e.g., blueshift into Milky Way)
6. **∇η_IGM** – field tension from large-scale structures (voids, filaments)
7. **η_aniso(θ,φ)** – directional anisotropy in decay
8. **η_fluct(x,t)** – wave interference, field echoes, collapse scars

Each contributes to the accumulated stretch or compression of wavefronts along the photon path.

---

## **Residual Modeling**

Residual redshift after accounting for modeled decay is:

\[
\Delta z = \ln(1 + z_{	ext{obs}}) - \ln(1 + z_{	ext{modeled}})
\]

This residual maps unresolved Gradia structures and η-wave effects. It is not noise but field information.

---

## **Remapping the Distance Modulus**

The corrected luminosity distance is:

\[
d_L^{	ext{QCFT}}(z) = rac{d_L^{	ext{GR}}(z)}{\eta(z)}
\]

and the distance modulus becomes:

\[
\mu(z) = 5 \log_{10} \left( rac{d_L^{	ext{GR}}(z)}{\eta(z)} ight) + \Delta \mu_{	ext{residual}}
\]

This formulation aligns with Pantheon+ SN1a data when η(z) is reconstructed empirically.

---

## **BAO Compression Explained**

Baryon Acoustic Oscillations appear compressed in QCFT due to η-field decay:

\[
d_{	ext{QCFT}} = rac{d_{	ext{GR}}}{\eta(z)}
\]

Wavefront compression reflects field viscosity evolution, not metric expansion.

---

## **CMB Angular Scale and η-Structure**

CMB anisotropies result from η² interference patterns and η-field projection at recombination-era viscosity. No photon decoupling is assumed. The angular scale reflects η-structure, not recombination temperature.

---

## **Direction-dependent η Mapping**

QCFT enables redshift residuals to reconstruct η(z, θ, φ), building anisotropic Gradia maps from SN1a, BAO, and CMB.

\[
	ext{Gradia} = |
abla \eta(x,t)|
\]

Redshift is thus a functional probe of cosmic tension and temporal topology.

---

## **Contrast with ΛCDM**

| Aspect | ΛCDM | QCFT |
|--------|------|------|
| Redshift | Metric expansion | η-decay + Gradia |
| Acceleration | Dark energy | None required |
| SN1a dimming | Expanding space | η-field dynamics |
| BAO scale | Co-moving metric | η-based contraction |
| CMB peaks | Early universe imprint | η-structure interference |

QCFT explains observations without metric stretch, using a dynamic time-viscosity field.

---

## **Conclusion**

Redshift is not a result of expanding spacetime but a cumulative trace of how the η-field evolves along a photon's path. QCFT reproduces all major cosmological observations — SN1a, BAO, and CMB — without dark energy or inflation, by modeling time as a dynamic, spatially structured viscosity field.

---

**Summary:**  
Cosmic redshift arises from η decay, Gradia traversal, and interference. Residuals expose field structure. Time does not stretch space — it decays, stretches itself, and leaves tension in its wake.

**The universe is not expanding.  
It is unfurling.**

## Theoretical Expansion

### 1. Canonical Redshift Equation in QCFT

The exponential redshift integral in QCFT marks a significant departure from Doppler or expansion-based interpretations. Rather than treating redshift as a result of recessional velocity or spacetime dilation, QCFT attributes it to the integral deformation of η(x,t) along a photon’s path. This reframing positions redshift as a cumulative memory of temporal viscosity — integrating both global decay and local structure.

The integral form:
\[
1 + z = \exp\left( \int_{\text{photon path}} \frac{d\eta(x,t)}{\eta(x,t)} \right)
\]
encapsulates the idea that redshift is not an instantaneous ratio between emitter and observer, but a field-mediated process across the entire trajectory. This opens the way for rich observational structure in redshift residuals, where local η features imprint on light in transit.

### 2. Contributing Components to Redshift

Each of the eight components described acts as a source of stretch or compression in the wavefront, directly tied to η variation. Temporal decay (∂η/∂t) forms the dominant cosmological redshift effect, but Gradia terms — ∇η at emission, in transit, and at reception — introduce spatial structure and directional dependence.

Papers 4 and 8 explore these contributions in real structure formation and anisotropy contexts, while Paper 10 models how η-scars and echoes from collapse events become embedded in residual spectra. These eight terms serve not only to decompose redshift, but to reconstruct η(x,t) observationally.

### 3. Residual Modeling

The residual redshift formula quantifies deviation from modeled decay. It is not an error term, but a source of field information:

\[
\Delta z = \ln(1 + z_{\text{obs}}) - \ln(1 + z_{\text{modeled}})
\]

This Δz maps unresolved η-fluctuations — such as those from topological wavefronts, interference nodes, or scars from chronode reactions. It offers a way to back-engineer η(x,t) distributions, particularly via high-resolution SN1a surveys or CMB angular structure.

### 4. Remapping the Distance Modulus

Because redshift is no longer purely kinematic, the luminosity distance must be re-expressed in terms of η(z):

\[
d_L^{\text{QCFT}}(z) = \frac{d_L^{\text{GR}}(z)}{\eta(z)}
\]

This correction factor scales down GR-based distances by the local field viscosity, matching the Pantheon+ dataset without requiring cosmic acceleration. The residual term Δμ captures Gradia-induced modulation, linking field theory with observation directly.

### 5. BAO Compression Explained

QCFT naturally explains BAO compression not as a shift in coordinate distances, but as a result of field decay. Since η determines apparent scale, a wavefront in a decaying viscosity field appears compressed:

\[
d_{\text{QCFT}} = \frac{d_{\text{GR}}}{\eta(z)}
\]

This field-based explanation removes the need for co-moving coordinates or inflating backgrounds, replacing them with temporal tension gradients that evolve in time.

### 6. CMB Angular Scale and η-Structure

QCFT reinterprets the CMB not as a relic from photon decoupling, but as a projection of the η² field at the time when large-scale coherence first stabilized. Peaks in the angular power spectrum represent interference zones in η, not acoustic oscillations.

Paper 4 and Paper 8 elaborate on this projection model, which avoids fine-tuned thermal histories and instead encodes early-universe Gradia topology. This view treats the CMB as a field-interference imprint, not a thermal remnant.

### 7. Direction-dependent η Mapping

The directional dependence of η — η(z,θ,φ) — reflects anisotropic decay and regional Gradia structure. By mapping redshift residuals across the sky, QCFT can reconstruct η-tension vectors and interference scars, building a topological map of the evolving field.

This method parallels gravitational lensing in GR, but does so from a time-viscosity perspective. It turns redshift surveys into field-mapping instruments, unlocking a new use for cosmological datasets.

### 8. Contrast with ΛCDM

The comparison table clarifies QCFT’s reframing of redshift-related observables. Where ΛCDM sees recession and metric expansion, QCFT sees field evolution and tension. Dark energy is rendered unnecessary. SN1a dimming and BAO compression follow from η(z); CMB peaks from η² interference; and the entire apparatus of inflation is bypassed.

This systemic reinterpretation is not a patch — it is a structural redefinition, linking redshift to a quantum field foundation. Papers 11 and 16 explore the comparative power and unification QCFT offers over ΛCDM and other TOE candidates.
