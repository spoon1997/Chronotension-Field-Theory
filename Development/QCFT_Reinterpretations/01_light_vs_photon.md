# 01 — Light vs Photon

---

## 🔍 Standard Interpretation: Photon

In conventional quantum electrodynamics (QED) and general physics:

- **Light is described as a photon** — a massless, chargeless quantum particle that carries electromagnetic energy.
- It exhibits both wave and particle behavior (wave–particle duality).
- It is the quantum of the EM field, with energy \( E = h\nu \).
- **Photons travel at the speed of light**, are emitted by atomic transitions, and are detected as discrete energy packets.

However, this model raises long-standing issues:
- Why does light self-interfere if it’s a particle?
- How can a single photon travel through two slits?
- What causes the wavefunction to “collapse” at measurement?
- What medium, if any, governs its propagation?

## 🌌 QCFT Interpretation: Light is an η-Wave

In **Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)**:

> **Light is not a particle at all.**  
> It is a **localized oscillation in the time-viscosity field** η(x,t).

### Core Features:
- **No photon exists** as an ontological object.
- Light is a **transient η-wavefront**, emitted by sudden η-structure changes (e.g. chronode transitions or FCEs).
- It **propagates through η(x,t)** as a ripple in time viscosity — not through empty space.
- Apparent quantization arises only during **discrete absorption**, not emission.
- Energy transfer is **field-topological**, not particle-mediated.

## 🧭 Comparison Table

| Feature                     | Standard View (Photon)              | QCFT View (η-Wave)                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Ontology                   | Particle (with wave duality)         | Pure field excitation (no duality)      |
| Medium                     | Vacuum (undefined carrier)           | η(x,t) field (time viscosity)           |
| Emission                   | Quantum jump of an atom              | η-collapse or chronode transition       |
| Propagation                | Travels through space at c           | Wavefront in η propagates in field tension |
| Detection                  | Photon absorption (discrete)         | η-energy absorbed by chronode           |
| Quantization               | Fundamental property of photons      | Emergent from discrete η-structure      |
| Wave–particle duality      | Unresolved paradox                   | Eliminated — wave is primary            |

## ✅ Why QCFT Is Better

1. **No duality paradox**: No need to treat light as both particle and wave — it's a coherent η-wave interacting with structured η-bound systems (chronodes).

2. **Causal clarity**: The emission, propagation, and absorption of light are all governed by continuous field dynamics — no probabilistic collapse or observer magic.

3. **No fundamental quantization**: Energy is not discretized at emission. Discreteness emerges **only in interaction**, like how a wave striking a bell gives a tone.

4. **Fits cosmic redshift naturally**: Light stretches because η decays with observer time — not because of metric expansion.

5. **Unifies all wave behavior**: From photons to sound to gravitational waves, all are η-field structures or propagations.

## 📌 Summary

In QCFT:

> **Light is a ripple in the flow of time — not a particle riding it.**

The photon is not fundamental, but a useful illusion arising from η-wave absorption.  
No “thing” travels — only the **tension in time** moves.

> “There are no photons. There is only field — and the memory of how it moved.”
