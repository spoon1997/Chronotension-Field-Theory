## 🧠 TL;DR: The 101 Rule of QCFT Clinical Neuroscience

> **All mental and neurological conditions are distortions of one thing: the η-gap.**

The η-gap is the **coherence zone** between chronodes — a real structure in the time-viscosity field η(x,t).  
Consciousness arises here. So do panic, depression, memory, trauma, and healing.

**When the self feels unstable, the η-gap has lost coherence.**

To restore it:
- Add **rhythm**
- Add **symmetry**
- Add **sensation**
- Add **movement**
- Remove imbalance (Gradia)
- Invite **coherence** back in.

Every condition becomes navigable once you **see the field**.

## 🔬 Why It Works

In QCFT, all experiences arise from the **interaction of chronodes within the η(x,t) field**.  
The key structure is the **η-gap** — a dynamic, coherent zone where time flows smoothly, identity holds, and awareness exists.

Every clinical condition reflects a **different way the η-gap can distort**:

- Collapse (panic, epilepsy)  
- Fragmentation (dissociation, trauma)  
- Incoherence (schizophrenia, Huntington’s)  
- Rigidity (OCD, autism)  
- Damping (depression)  
- Loss of return loop (ALS, Alzheimer’s)

And **every healing path** involves **inviting η back into balance** — through rhythm, symmetry, reconnection, or safe phase realignment.
