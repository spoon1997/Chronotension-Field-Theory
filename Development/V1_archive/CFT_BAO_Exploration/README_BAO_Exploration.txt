Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) BAO Sound Horizon Exploration

1. Initial attempt to calculate the sound horizon (r_s) using CFT remapped H(z) resulted in a value ~35761 Mpc,
   which is much larger than the observed ~147 Mpc in ΛCDM.

2. Issues identified:
   - Units mismatch and improper scaling in initial integrals.
   - Lack of radiation and early-universe physics in current H(z) modeling.
   - η(z) remapping function may not capture sharp early-universe viscosity changes.

3. Next steps suggested:
   - Incorporate radiation density and recombination physics in H(z).
   - Refine η(z) functional form to include sharp decays.
   - Consider alternative BAO peak prediction methods.

All code, plots, and intermediate results are saved for further investigation.
