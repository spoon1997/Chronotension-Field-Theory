# Chronotension Field Theory: Soliton Mapping & Chronode Identification

**Author**: Luke W. Cann  
**Status**: Confirmed derivation of soliton dynamics from Chronotension Field Theory (CFT)

## Summary

This document establishes a formal correspondence between soliton-supporting field equations in classical physics and the Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) model...
