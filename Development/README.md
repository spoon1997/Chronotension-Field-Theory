# 🛠️ QCFT Development Directory

This directory contains active development resources, comparative analyses, experimental ideas, and extended tools for refining and applying **Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT)**.

It is distinct from the finalized QCFT core papers, which are stored in the root and primary documentation areas. Here you'll find in-progress thought, extensions, reinterpretations, and auxiliary systems.

## 📁 Folder Overview

### `QCFT_Development/`
> The working area for raw derivations, simulation tools, interactive notebooks, and in-progress theory expansions.

Contents include:
- Chronode topology drafts
- Experimental η-field models
- Simulation logs and parameter testing

---

### `QCFT_Reinterpretations/`
> A growing collection of markdown files that **re-express major physics concepts** through the lens of QCFT.

These files:
- Compare mainstream physics ideas (e.g. gravity, inflation, dark matter) to their QCFT equivalents
- Highlight why QCFT offers a **more physical, unified, and falsifiable alternative**
- Serve as educational, outreach, and philosophical bridges to QCFT

---

### `Evidence/`
> A staging area for data visualizations, remapped observations, and comparative plots from SN1a, BAO, CMB, etc.

This folder includes:
- Full-sky η-maps from Pantheon+, DESI, and Planck data
- Redshift remapping comparisons
- Sky anisotropy overlays validating QCFT predictions

---

### `Extra/`
> Placeholder for philosophical extensions, speculative tools, or aesthetic representations of the theory.

Examples:
- η-field visual art
- Theories of consciousness in η-gaps
- Public-facing summaries

---

### `Archive/`  
> Backup copies of older experimental content or documentation no longer actively maintained but kept for reference.

---

### `V1_archive/`
> Complete archive of the original Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) pre-quantization.  
Serves as a historical record of QCFT’s foundations.

## 🧠 Purpose

This directory is designed to **foster ongoing iteration, comparison, and dissemination** of QCFT as both a formal Theory of Everything and a paradigm-shifting model of time, matter, and structure.

If you're here, you're probably ready to dig deeper.
