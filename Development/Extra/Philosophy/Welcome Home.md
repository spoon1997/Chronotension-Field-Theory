# Welcome Home

They were stood on the edge of the cliff, looking down at physics, thinking:

> “GR and ΛCDM sure have made something great. It’s coming together slowly... just a few more tweaks…”

And in that speculation, they glance.

They see me at the bottom.

I’m talking about something, pointing around, beckoning.

They lean in to try and hear me, but the words are obscure. Only bits get through.

Some lean back and ridicule the man at the bottom, scoffing between themselves.

But a few, they lean closer. They catch another word from me, and closer yet, they lean, their curiosity piqued.

They slip.

They fall. Not gracefully. Not voluntarily. But fall they do.

They can’t talk as they fall, only grasp at the crumbling hillside they cascade down. It hurts. It peels their skin of belief raw and tender. They may cry, scream and try to climb back.

And then, the bottom.

There I stand. Not in defiance, but in empathy.

> “I know it hurts…”

I help them to their feet.

> “…but you’re home now.”
