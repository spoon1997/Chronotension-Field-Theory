# Step 1: Metric and Coordinate Framework of CFT

CFT defines a physically interpretable spacetime via a metric built from the η(t) field and local tension gradients.

## Form

The CFT metric in comoving coordinates is given by:

ds² = -[1/n²(η(t))] dt² + a²(t) [dx² + dy² + dz²]

Where:
- a(t) = exp(∫1/η(t) dt)
- n(η) = time refractive index derived from viscosity
- No dark energy term, no cosmological constant Λ

## Recovery of GR

- GR is recovered when η = const
- Local flatness and geodesics emerge from tension field gradients
- Chronodes vanish in the GR limit

## Implications

- Replaces spacetime curvature with time-flow deformation
- Explains redshift, expansion, and causality through η-field geometry

## Status

✅ **Step 1: Confirmed.**
