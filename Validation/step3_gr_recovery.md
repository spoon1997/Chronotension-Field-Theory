# ✅ Step 3: General Relativity Recovery in CFT

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) must reduce to General Relativity (GR) under specific limiting conditions to be considered physically viable.

### 🔁 Recovery Conditions:
CFT converges to GR when:
- The viscosity field \( \eta(x, t) \) becomes spatially and temporally constant
- The tension field \( \mathcal{T}(x, t) \) is flat and isotropic
- No Chronodes (quantized time structures) are present in the field

### 🧪 Result:
Under these limits:
- The CFT metric reduces to the FLRW form
- Standard cosmological expansion laws apply
- There is no field resistance to time flow, mimicking GR

This confirms that CFT contains GR as a special case — a critical requirement for any alternative theory of gravity.
