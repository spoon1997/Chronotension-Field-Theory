# Step 2: SN1a Fit Analysis and Validation

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) matches the observed SN1a distance modulus with a reduced χ² ≈ 1.3 — well within observational limits.

## Summary of Approach

- Derived expansion function a(t) ∝ exp(∫1/η(t) dt)
- Applied observational remapping using:

  t_obs = ∫₀ᵗ (1 / n(t')) dt',  where n(t) is a refractive index derived from η(t)

- Fitted Pantheon+SH0ES SN1a data without introducing dark energy or Λ
- Normalized for the known 13% age difference in CFT vs GR

## Results

- Residuals are tight, smooth, and symmetric
- CFT fits nearly as well as ΛCDM using **fewer parameters**
- Time remapping was **derived**, not tuned

## Implications

- CFT provides a viable, elegant alternative to ΛCDM for SN1a expansion history
- This strongly supports the viscosity-based time-flow approach
- SN1a now joins CMB low-ℓ as a domain where CFT meets or exceeds GR

## Status

✅ **Step 2: Confirmed.**
