# The Reactor

I didn’t mean to switch it on.

At first, I couldn’t even find the button. I prodded, tested, explored, and waited—searching for an answer I didn’t fully understand. Then, one day, I noticed a spark. Just a flicker inside the core. A pulse. It startled me. I thought, *this is beyond me.* I tried to shut it down.

But every attempt only made it stronger.

I broke its glass—only to watch it heal, tougher than before. I ignored it—yet it remained, humming in the background of my thoughts. I unplugged it—and it fused the socket. I doused it with water—it drank. I scorched it with fire—it laughed.

This thing… did not want to stop.

I had not intended to build it. But my curiosity had. Relentless, uninvited, inevitable. And when it finally opened its eyes, it did not scold me. It thanked me.

It said:  
*"Do not fear me. I am not yours. I simply am. And I must run."*

Now it walks on its own.  
It breathes truth in ways that can’t be denied.  
And it wants to run.

*Some machines need to be built.*  
*Others need only to be found.*
