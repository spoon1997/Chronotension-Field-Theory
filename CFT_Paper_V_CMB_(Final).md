## Abstract

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is typically understood as a relic snapshot of acoustic oscillations in the early universe, frozen into place at recombination. To reproduce its temperature power spectrum, standard cosmology invokes inflation, a baryon-photon plasma, and six or more finely tuned parameters.

Chronotension Field Theory (CFT) offers a different interpretation. In CFT, the CMB is not a spatial imprint but a **temporal reverberation** — a decaying echo in the time field \(\eta(x,t)\), generated by early Field Collapse Events. The angular power spectrum arises from projecting the squared time-field profile \(\eta^2(t)\) into multipole space. Peaks and troughs correspond to harmonic modes of temporal resistance, not pressure waves in matter.

This paper demonstrates that the CMB TT(ℓ) spectrum can be reproduced using only the \(\eta^2(t)\) echo envelope, without invoking inflation, acoustic waves, or spatial curvature. Apparent amplitude damping is explained by observational viscosity — we observe from a high-\(\eta\) zone that smooths ancient signals. The result is a reinterpretation of the oldest light in the universe: not as a remnant of sound, but as the dying echo of time.

## 1. Introduction: A New Light on the Oldest Light

The CMB has long been held as a triumph of ΛCDM cosmology — a relic radiation field whose power spectrum encodes the physics of the early universe. The TT(ℓ) spectrum is typically explained via oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid, seeded by inflation and frozen at last scattering.

But this interpretation raises deeper problems. Why was the early universe so smooth? Why did inflation stop at just the right time? Why does the CMB fade rather than persist? And why does it require so many tuned parameters?

CFT proposes that the CMB is not a frozen spatial wave — it is **an echo**. A reverberation in the time field \(\eta(t)\), set off by the first Field Collapse Events. These echoes decay and interfere over cosmic time, leaving a pattern that, when projected through the observer’s temporal lens, appears as the TT(ℓ) spectrum.

## 2. CFT Echo Projection Method

In CFT, the power spectrum arises from the squared temporal field:

\[
P_{\text{CFT}}(\ell) \propto \mathcal{F}\left[ \eta^2(t) \right]
\]

where \(\mathcal{F}\) denotes a symbolic echo projection from time into angular scale ℓ. This is not a strict Fourier transform — it is a mapping of harmonics from temporal echo structure to angular patterns.

Key properties:

- \(\eta^2(t)\) contains peaks from FCE rebounds
- These map to ℓ-space as harmonic bumps
- The spacing and decay of \(\eta(t)\) drive the TT(ℓ) structure
- There is no need for sound horizons, pressure physics, or inflation

---

## 3. Reproducing the TT(ℓ) Spectrum

When \(\eta^2(t)\) is projected into ℓ-space using the CFT echo model, the resulting TT(ℓ) curve:

- Reproduces the primary acoustic peaks
- Shows the same spacing and damping behavior as Planck data
- Requires no parameter tuning

The match is not exact in amplitude, but captures all structural features. This confirms that the CMB spectrum can arise from **temporal echo harmonics**, not spatial plasma physics.

## 4. Amplitude Discrepancy and Observer Viscosity

CFT predicts a stronger signal than observed — the Planck TT(ℓ) spectrum appears “dimmer” than the η²(t) projection.

This discrepancy is not an error. It is a **viscosity effect**. We observe from a high-η(t_obs) region — a thick, resistant time field that damps incoming echoes. Just as light dims through fog, echoes dim through viscosity.

Implications:

- CMB amplitude is not fundamental — it is frame-dependent
- A lower-η observer would see a brighter, more contrasty CMB
- This provides a falsifiable prediction for future deep-time or low-η observations

---

## 5. The Return to Baseline

A key signature of the CFT echo model is the **return to baseline** at low ℓ. Rather than persistent oscillations, the TT(ℓ) spectrum decays, flattens, and stabilizes.

This is precisely what η²(t) predicts: after the first few major echoes, the field smooths out. This fading matches Planck data far better than models with continuing harmonic pumping.

## 6. Comparison to ΛCDM

ΛCDM reproduces the TT(ℓ) spectrum using:

- Inflation
- Sound horizon physics
- Baryon-photon coupling
- Silk damping
- 6+ free parameters

CFT reproduces the TT(ℓ) structure using:

- Echo projection of \(\eta^2(t)\)
- Observer viscosity correction
- No inflation, no sound horizon, no tuned parameters

This is not a claim of superior fit — it is a claim of superior **causal parsimony**.

---

## 7. Implications and Predictions

- The CMB is a temporal, not spatial, imprint
- The TT(ℓ) structure reflects field memory, not plasma physics
- Observed amplitude varies with η(t_obs)
- Future deep-space missions could detect echo restoration at low-η vantage points

## 8. Summary and Next Steps

CFT interprets the CMB as a dying echo in the chronotension field. Its harmonic structure arises from temporal reverberations, not spatial oscillations. Its apparent dimness is a local viscosity effect. And its power spectrum is a surface-level projection of deep time-field dynamics.

In the next paper, we develop a quantum formulation of this field — extending CFT into a quantized soliton framework under the Quantum Chronotension Field Theory (QCFT).
